Currently serving as an Adjunct Assistant Professor of Data Science and Business Analytics at [Nova SBE](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/faculty-research/faculty/faculty-detail/id/1267/rongjiao-ji), Rongjiao Ji predominantly instructs courses in data curation, data visualization, digital experimentation, and computer programming, across both undergraduate and graduate programs. She earned her Ph.D. from the Mathematics Department of Universit√† degli Studi di Milano (University of Milan) under the [BIGMATH program](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/812912), a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action, in collaboration with 3Lateral. Her doctoral research centered on facial emotion detection, sentiment analysis, and natural language processing. Ji holds a Master's degree in Mathematics and Applications from the Institute Superior Tecnico (University of Lisbon), and a Bachelor's degree in Information and Computing Science from the Dalian University of Technology. Before her Ph.D., she worked as a research assistant at the Signal Processing and Image Group at the Institute for Systems and Robotics in Lisbon.


%The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
